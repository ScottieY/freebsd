/*
 * Altera PLL "register offsets."
 *
 * Communication with the ALTPLL_RECONFIG IP core happens over a proprietary
 * serial interface. A small perhipheral caches the parameters and streams them
 * to the PLL by trigging a write with a specified address bit high. From the
 * driver's perspective we just pretend to have a set of 32-bit registers.
 *
 * Address Bits  Description
 *          1-0  Always zero (word aligned)
 *          5-2  Counter type
 *          8-6  Counter parameter
 *            9  Set to 1 and write for transfer to PLL.
 *               Read returns 0x0d when the transfer is complete.
